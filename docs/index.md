Upstreet is an open source virtual world built on principles of enabling true digital ownership, an open economy, and interoperability. There's several parts:

- Tools to create and monetize content
- Custom avatars + multiplayer + VR support
- Discovery of amazing experiences across the Internet

The virtual world is organized around one main street, like a web page that goes forwards and backwards instead of up and down. It's also a metaphor for a blockchain, in which The Street is the ever expanding chain connecting the blocks that contributors help shape throughout time.

The Street is a curated quality experience, coordinated in artistic direction per season theme. Along The Street are various areas of land that users can own and control called [parcels](/docs/upstreet/parcels), which can be linked to full experiences within or outside the platform.

### Seasons

Seasons are the release cadence for the many ideas cooking together. The current plan is to curate the best parts the community likes about video games + the web into unique digital assets ([NFTs](./upstreet/items)) that get released periodically during every season.

The Street will extend to the start of every new season while still being connected the previous season. Users will be able to able to travel back in history to previous seasons, like crawling a blockchain back to the genesis block.

If you're interested in participating as a craetor in the next season, take a look at the creator program below and drop into the [Discord](https://discord.gg/R5wqYhvv53) to introduce yourself.

## Getting Started 

![](/img/ethbot.jpg)

There's a couple ways to get setup. The easiest way is by joining the Upstreet [Discord server](https://discord.gg/R5wqYhvv53) and using the [bot](https://docs.upstreet.ai/docs/upstreet/discord-bot). Minting NFTs is free, but you'll need [SILK](./silk) in order to use the tools.

- Join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/R5wqYhvv53) and introduce yourself
  - Type `.name -h` in the Discord to learn how to setup your username
  - Login to the main website by typing `.login`
  - Ask for some [SILK](/docs/upstreet/silk) to create items

The NFT Discord bot automatically generates everybody on the server its in an Ethereum address on a sidechain that's tied to their unique Discord id. To check yours, just type `.address` and see.

> Note: you can always import or export your private keys from your discord wallet or transfer your NFTs out.

The other way is by signing in through the website [https://upstreet.ai](https://upstreet.ai). You can use Metamask, email, or Discord to log in.


**Set your avatar**

The easiest way to make your own custom VRM avatar is with [VRoid Studio](https://vroid.com/en/studio/). Once you've created your avatar with VRoid Studio, you can [import into Upstreet](/docs/create/import-vroid).

> Note: Be sure to double check the optimization settings on the export page to get the best performance from your avatar.

Check out the [avatars](./upstreet/avatars) page for more information on setting your avatar.
